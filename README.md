# summer18_cs
Repo for the HMC CS35 work done over summer '18

## Disclaimer

Not all of the assignments are done; not all of the parts of assignments are done. This was not an attempt to actually take the class, it was an excercise in going through the material to see how it was delivered and learn anything I hadn't already learned. Once I got the gist of an assignment, I moved on. This is a great class, but I was doing this as the first step in a 10 week summer research project, so I had time constraints and goals outside legitimately taking the class. The full class can be found here: https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/cs35/
