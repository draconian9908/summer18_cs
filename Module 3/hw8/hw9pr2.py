# ## Homework _9_ (not 8): Problem 2, steganography
# 
# This question asks you to write two functions, likely with some helper functions, that will enable you
# to embed arbitrary text (string) messages into an image (if there is enough room!)

# For extra credit, the challenge is to be
# able to extract/embed an image into another image...

#
# You'll want to borrow from hw8pr1 for
#  + opening the file
#  + reading the pixels
#  + create some helper functions!
#  + also, check out the slides :-) 
#
# Happy steganographizing, everyone!
#





# Part A: here is a signature for the decoding
# remember - you will want helper functions!
def desteg_string( image ):
    """ be sure to include a better docstring here! """
    pass




# Part B: here is a signature for the encoding/embedding
# remember - you will want helper functions!
def steganographize( image, message ):
    """ be sure to include a better docstring here! """
    pass
