There should be a lot more files here than there are -- this is intentional, because GitHub limits how much can be uploaded at once, and trying to upload all the files for these excercises would take a very long time and there isn't really much point to doing so. If you want the files, you can download the full set of files from the HMC CS35 course website for hw0: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kB6Jrrs5VKhoXZDdBHkuWXaMmP5tZ3GwcfNTKYYahi4/edit
